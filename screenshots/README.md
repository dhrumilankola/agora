## Tips for Great Screenshots

- Use a clean browser window (hide bookmarks bar, extensions)
- Capture on a high-resolution display for crisp images
- Show the app in an active, engaging state (not empty/loading)
- Consider adding a subtle border or shadow for better visibility in README
- Optimize file sizes (keep under 500KB each for fast loading)

## File Formats
- **Preferred**: PNG for crisp UI screenshots
- **Alternative**: JPG for smaller file sizes (if quality remains good)

Once you add these images, they'll automatically appear in the main README! ðŸš€
